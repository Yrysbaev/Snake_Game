The Snake game is a charming and simple challenge to play during downtime.

To play Snake, use the arrow keys to move the snake left, right, up, or down towards the apples. As you eat apples, the snake will get longer and more difficult to avoid.

To get the Snake world record, you must avoid eating your tail and hitting the walls or borders of the screen.

Like other arcade games, Snake is all about angles and physics. Make sure you turn at the right time, and use the grid to judge when you need to change directions.
